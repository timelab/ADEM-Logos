# Timelab ADEM project logos

[ADEM](http://ik-adem.be) is a community based, open source, citizen science project, which enables cyclists to measure air pollution (PM10 and PM25 particles). Through the mapping of air quality, the project aims to raise awareness on health and ecology in an urban context. The project spans from the hardware and software development of the device and visualization tools, as well as impact analysis and the transfer of knowledge through workshops and campaign material.

This repository hosts the logos for the project &mdash; including laser/sticker cutter ready versions of the designs.

The project's website is [ik-adem.be](http://ik-adem.be) (ultimately the gathered data will be visualized there).

The hardware designs, firmware and technical documentation can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/timelab/ADEM).

We welcome feedback and contributions.
